warping
v warping: number of cross detection
_ warp/mapping: NetCDF support
_ warp/mapping: map(2,2,np,2(or 3)) contains (x,y(,z)) in image coordinate (i.e. pixel,pixel,plane), need to add (X,Y(,Z)) in real coordinate.
  _ map(2,2,np,4(or 6))
  _ use it for mapping image bound definition (i.e. image size), presently: bounds = 4 crosses
  _ use it for mapping plane point definition (i.e. plane position in space), presently: plane = z0=float constant

3D warping
v warping: 2D to 3D warping, i.e. single plane to multiple (e.g. 3 planes)
  v -nz
  v -oc
  v -i stdin
  v -o
  v -gz
  _ -os (?one size/grid per plane: z axis)
v mapping: 2D mapping in 3D space
  v at z constant
  _ in a plane through 3 points
v warping: detection of crosses on other planes
_ warp/mapping: size differ in planes (i.e. grid also), user might select the best, but differ little only.
