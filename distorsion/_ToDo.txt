warping
_ warping: detection of cross number


3D warping
_ warping: 2D to 3D warping, i.e. single plane to multiple (e.g. 3 planes)
  v -nz
  v -oc
  v -i stdin
  . -o
  _ -os (?one size/grid per plane: z axis)
  _ -gz
_ mapping: 2D mapping in 3D space 1. at z, 2. in a plane through 3 points
_ warping: detection of crosses on other planes
_ warp/mapping: size differ in planes (i.e. grid also), user might select the best, but differ little only.
